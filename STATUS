RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * OpenSSL detection in crypto configure is broken.
      At least on Solaris you need to add -lsocket -lnsl -ldl
      when you link against OpenSSL.
      We could use pkgconfig where available.
      HTTPD uses a macro APACHE_CHECK_SSL_TOOLKIT whih itself
      uses pkgconfig. If pkgconfig is not available, it finds
      the libs more or less by accident via apr-config.
      APR trunk has the needed libs already in the LIBS when testing
      for OpenSSL.

    * Solaris's Sun Freeware (sfw) package has a busted gcc/ld setup.
      This gcc passes -L/opt/sfw/lib to /usr/ccs/bin/ld, but does not 
      pass -R.  Therefore, when trying to run the code using a
      library from /opt/sfw/lib (say, libdb), the run-time linker
      will not look in /opt/sfw/lib and the program will die.
        Status: Workaround is to add "-R/opt/sfw/lib" to LDFLAGS.
                Should check latest sfw package set and see if Sun
                may have fixed this.

    * GDBM usage of errno is not-thread-safe.  Fix.

    * Expat 1.99.2 is getting stale, 1.99.8 for sanity's sake, and
      push to Expat 2.x for apr-util 2.0

    * http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/downloads.jsp
      (under an X-style license) for an apr_xlate alternative to iconv

Other bugs that need fixing:



Other features that need writing:

    * possibly move test/testdbm* to util/dbu
      Justin says: Do we still want to do this?  testdate is now in test.
      Status: Greg +1 (volunteers)

Documentation that needs writing:

    * API documentation
        Status:

    * doc the lifetimes of apr_dbm return values


Available Patches:


Open Issues:

    * unify parsing of prepared statements in DBD
      Status: committed, awaiting review
              format of arguments (i.e. %s, %d etc.) needs to be agreed upon

    * add binary argument functions to DBD
      Status: committed, awaiting review
              API needs to be agreed upon
