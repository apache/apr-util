RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * Solaris's Sun Freeware (sfw) package has a busted gcc/ld setup.
      This gcc passes -L/opt/sfw/lib to /usr/ccs/bin/ld, but does not 
      pass -R.  Therefore, when trying to run the code using a
      library from /opt/sfw/lib (say, libdb), the run-time linker
      will not look in /opt/sfw/lib and the program will die.
        Status: Workaround is to add "-R/opt/sfw/lib" to LDFLAGS.
                Should check latest sfw package set and see if Sun
                may have fixed this.

    * GDBM usage of errno is not-thread-safe.  Fix.

Other bugs that need fixing:



Other features that need writing:

    * possibly move test/testdbm* to util/dbu
      Justin says: Do we still want to do this?  testdate is now in test.
      Status: Greg +1 (volunteers)

Documentation that needs writing:

    * API documentation
        Status:

    * doc the lifetimes of apr_dbm return values
