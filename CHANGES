Changes with APR-util 1.0.2

  *) Fix handling of a premature EOF with the FILE bucket; a new bucket
     is not inserted for each attempt to read past EOF.  PR 34708.
     [Jeff Trawick, Joe Orton]

  *) Fix build failure with non-threaded APR on AIX.  PR 34655.
     [Ryan Murray <rmurray+apache cyberhqz.com>]

  *) Make install passed a shell expanded list of header files to the
     build/install.sh script, which can only install one file at a time.
     Changed to install one header file at a time. [Justin Erenkrantz,
     Graham Leggett]

  *) Rework the LDAP toolkit detection to be more accurate than "OpenLDAP
     detected regardless", while remaining backwards compatible with v1.0.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Added the apr_ldap_ssl_add_cert() API to allow multiple certificates
     to be stored and used when establishing an SSL connection to different
     LDAP servers. [Brad Nicholes]
     
  *) Fix the detection of ldap.h on Solaris - it needs lber.h to be
     defined first. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add a build script to create a solaris package. [Graham Leggett]

Changes with APR-util 1.0.1

  *) Add support for Berkeley DB 4.3.  [Jani Averbach <jaa jaa.iki.fi>]

  *) SECURITY: CAN-2004-0786 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix input validation in apr_uri_parse() to avoid passing negative
     length to memcpy for malformed IPv6 literal addresses.
     [Joe Orton]

Changes with APR-util 1.0

  *) Only install apu-$MAJOR-config and add appropriate detection code to
     find_apu.m4 (APU_FIND_APU).  [Max Bowsher <maxb ukf.net>]

  *) Overhaul support for LDAP URL parsing. Instead of using incompatible
     URL parsers and memory that needs freeing, apr-util provides a parser
     which parses the URL and allocates memory from a pool. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Remove support for LDAP v2.0 SDK toolkits. This will be added
     back properly later assuming there is demand for it. In the mean
     time, please use an LDAP v3.0 SDK toolkit. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add an apr_ldap_err_t structure to handle the return of LDAP
     specific error codes. [Graham Leggett, Brad Nicholes]

  *) Add APR functions to do the job of ldap_init(), hiding toolkit
     specific SSL/TLS handling. Code derived from httpd util_ldap.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add an RPM spec file derived from Fedora Core.
     [Graham Leggett, Joe Orton]

  *) The whole codebase was relicensed and is now available under
     the Apache License, Version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses).
     [Apache Software Foundation]

  *) A new function, apr_reslist_invalidate, was added so that invalid
     resources can be removed from a reslist instead of being returned
     to the reslist in a broken state.  [Nick Kew <nick webthing.com>]

  *) Switch to a single, top-level make. [Greg Stein]

  *) Add timeout feature to apr_reslist_acquire().  
     [Mladen Turk <mturk apache.org>]

  *) Pass error codes returned from constructors all the way back to
     the reslist consumer. Also fix a minor reslist memory leak that could
     happen when a constructor returns an error code.  PR 23492.
     [Snke Tesch <st@kino-fahrplan.de>, Aaron Bannert]

  *) The following header files have been removed:

     apu_compat.h
