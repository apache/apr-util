As of apr-util version 1.2.11, MySQL DBD driver is shipped as part of the
distribution.  However, to avoid licensing incompatibilities, it is not
built by default.  To enable MySQL support, use the --with-mysql option,
but be aware that the MySQL license may introduce licensing implications
for your compiled code.
